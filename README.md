# Creating our React App
Let‚Äôs create a react app by running the following command from the terminal / command prompt:
```bash
create-react-app todoreact
```
This will create a react app in a folder called ‚Äú**todoreact**‚Äù.
Instead of naming your project ‚Äú**todoreact**‚Äù you can call it whatever you want. Just know that a project folder will be created for whatever name you choose when creating your React App. When the project setup is done, you will receive a message in the terminal that looks like this:

```
Success! Created todoreact at /Users/Alvaro/Documents/Projects/todoreact
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
npm start
    Starts the development server.
npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.
npm test
    Starts the test runner.
npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can‚Äôt go back!
We suggest that you begin by typing:
cd todoreact
  npm start
  
```
Now the real fun begins. Let‚Äôs have a look at our project folder and try to understand what it looks like, why it‚Äôs organized the way it is and the purpose of each file in the project.
Let‚Äôs go into our project directory now and see what we are dealing with:

```
todoreact/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  .gitignore
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

**README.md:** For providing some information about the project you are working on and if applicable, include setup & installation documentation.


**node_modules:** What happens is Create-React-App took care of adding all the necessary javascript libraries we needed and when those libraries get downloaded, they are stored in this node_modules folder.


**package.json:** I like to think of this file as a blueprint of the project. Let‚Äôs look at it‚Äôs content.
```json
{
  "name": "todoreact",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "0.6.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^15.3.2",
    "react-dom": "^15.3.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```
**.gitignore:** This is used by git to identify what needs to ignored when version controlling your work.
**public:** index.html and favicon.ico! So this index.html file is the page that will actually render everything we do. If you wanted to add some meta tags, web fonts, analytics scripts, etc ‚Ä¶ this is where you would do them too.
**src:** Now to the fun part! This is where we will be spending most of our time. Let‚Äôs do this:
- **App.css:** Styling of our app goes here. It‚Äôs standard CSS so nothing new here.
- **App.js:** React uses a component-based-architecture (C.B.A.), so every element on your User Interface can be thought of as a component. That means the main container of your app is the main component. Which has children components which have children components and so on. So this App.js is the component class for our ‚ÄúApp‚Äù component.
- **App.test.js:** We won‚Äôt go into testing for now, but just know that C.R.A. supports testing and for every component we create.
- **index.js:** This is the entry point into our src folder. So this is the file where we import all our components, classes, stylesheets and render our ‚ÄúApp‚Äù component.
- **logo.svg:** Since we aren‚Äôt writing HTML directly here, if we need to add any type of assets (images, videos, fonts, etc ‚Ä¶) in our src folder. You can always create other folders to separate your assets, what‚Äôs important is knowing that your assets can be imported into your components.

# Running Our App
We are almost done! Now we know what our project structure looks like. Let‚Äôs run it and see what happens.
From your terminal / command prompt (which you should still have open), type the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
Now, go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Even if you have an idea of what your app is going to look like in the end, you start with single blocks. Each block on its own is functional and can help you do build something. You can even build bigger blocks out of smaller ones and join them together.

That‚Äôs actually how Component-Based-Architecture works. So think about our todo app again. And think about it in terms of building blocks that you need to have all the functions of the app working. How would you split the app then?

- App Component
- Avatar Component
- Date Component
- Task List Component
- Task Component
- Add Button Component

**src/App.css:** Delete Everything
**src/App.js:** Edit it so it doesn‚Äôt import logo.svg and only returns Hello World. It should look like this:

**src/index.css:** Delete everything

**public/index.html:** Change title to TodoReact
Now reloading our project in the browser should give us a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù message.

## Creating The Task Component
Lets add a new file called **Task.js** to our src folder. As a reminder, this is what the task component would look like:

Looking at how this task component should look, it seems it could use a little help from a grid layout. Thankfully, Bootstrap can be easily integrated into our project. From the terminal / command prompt, run:
`npm install react-bootstrap --save && npm install bootstrap@3 --save`
We will also use font awesome for the check & remove icons so let‚Äôs install that too:
`npm install react-fontawesome --save && npm install font-awesome --save`
After installing these, we need to import our css files in our **index.js** file.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';
import 'font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css';

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now let‚Äôs create the basic structure of our **Task** component

```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Row, Col} from 'react-bootstrap';
import FontAwesome from 'react-fontawesome';

class Task extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Row>
                    <Col xs={1}>
                        <div>
                            <p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontWeight: 'bold', paddingTop: '10px'}}>8
                                <br/>
                                <span>AM</span>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={10}>
                        <h4 id="activity-title">Storefoundry Branding</h4>
                        <p>Ideation/Sketch/Wireframing</p>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={1}>
                        <Row style={{paddingTop: '10px'}}>
                          <Col xs={6}>
                            <FontAwesome name='times' />
                          </Col>
                          <Col xs={6}>
                            <FontAwesome name='check' />
                          </Col>
                        </Row>
                    </Col>
                </Row>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Task;
```

Now that we have created our task component, we can use it just like any other component.
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Task from './Task.js';

import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
          <Task />
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

No Styling yet ‚Ä¶ I know I know üòâ. Let‚Äôs focus on building blocks before worrying about styling.
So now that have built a task component and can render it, can we build a task list component that will render 5 task components? But of course!
Let‚Äôs create a **TaskList** component by adding a file called **TaskList.js** to our src folder.
```javascript

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Task from './Task.js';

class TaskList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
          <Task />
          <Task />
          <Task />
          <Task />
          <Task />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default TaskList;
```

In this case, we simply imported our **Task** component and rendered 5 tasks to have our task list component.
After this, let‚Äôs modify **App.js** to render our task list component.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
          <TaskList />
      </div>

    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

How about a **Date** Component that will sit on top of our **Task List** component? Let‚Äôs do it!
Let‚Äôs create a **Date.js** file in our src folder.
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class Date extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Thursday</h1>
                <p>May 19, 2016</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Date;
```

Now let‚Äôs add our **Date** Component to our **App.js** file so it sits on top of the tasks list.
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';
import Date from './Date.js';

import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{padding: '30px 30px'}}>
          <Date />
          <br />
          <TaskList />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

We will repeat the same process to add an avatar component and an add button component.
### Avatar.js
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Row, Col, Image} from 'react-bootstrap';

class Avatar extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
              <Row>
                <Col xs={10}></Col>
                <Col xs={2}>
                  <Image src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/200/200/1*qSozwB2ZQYFRd07N7rLzGw.jpeg" thumbnail circle />
                </Col>
              </Row>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Avatar;
```

I chose to use the Image component from React bootstrap here but using the default img works just fine.
### AddButton.js
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Row, Col, Button} from 'react-bootstrap';
import FontAwesome from 'react-fontawesome';

class AddButton extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
              <Row>
                <Col xs={10}></Col>
                <Col xs={2}>
                  <Button bsStyle="danger" bsSize="large">
                    <FontAwesome name='plus' />
                  </Button>
                </Col>
              </Row>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default AddButton;
```

Final version of our **App.js** would then look like this:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';
import Date from './Date.js';
import Avatar from './Avatar.js';
import AddButton from './AddButton.js';

import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{padding: '30px 30px'}}>
          <Avatar />
          <br />
          <Date />
          <br />
          <TaskList />
          <br />
          <AddButton />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

But our list of tasks is static. Our date is also static. And we can‚Äôt actually add new tasks to this list yet. Yuck!

Let‚Äôs start with an easy one. Our Date component is supposed to simply display the current date.
Currently, our date component looks like this:
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class Date extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Thursday</h1>
                <p>May 19, 2016</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Date;
```

So what we need todo is make that the date be dynamic and display the current date. Luckily, there‚Äôs a great library for working with dates in javascript: MomentJS. So let‚Äôs use that to display our date. First of all, let‚Äôs install it with the following command:
```bash
npm install moment --save
```
After installing the moment library, we can import it and use it like this:
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import Moment from 'moment';

class Date extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>{Moment().format('dddd')}</h1>
                <p>{Moment().format('LL')}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Date;
```
Hehe, looks like magic but it‚Äôs not really difficult. First off, there‚Äôs the use of the single curly braces around our html tags. This is necessary so we can tell our transpiler that the code in the braces is javascript code that needs to be executed and evaluated.

By following the momentjs documentation, using the format function with a format string gives us exactly what we need. By default Moment() returns the date & time as of when it‚Äôs executed. So applying the ‚Äòdddd‚Äô format gives us the full day (e.g. Monday, Tuesday ‚Ä¶) instead of a number (e.g. Monday = 1). And the ‚ÄòLL‚Äô format gives us the date as ‚ÄúMonth Name, Day of Month, Year‚Äù.

Perfect! Now let‚Äôs do something more interesting. Our TaskList component right now displays a static list of 5 components. They all display the same thing. What we will do first is tweak up our task component so that we can pass some data to it and make it dynamic. Currently, our task component looks like this:
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Row, Col} from 'react-bootstrap';
import FontAwesome from 'react-fontawesome';

class Task extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Row>
                    <Col xs={1}>
                        <div>
                            <p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontWeight: 'bold', paddingTop: '10px'}}>8
                                <br/>
                                <span>AM</span>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={10}>
                        <h4 id="activity-title">Storefoundry Branding</h4>
                        <p>Ideation/Sketch/Wireframing</p>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={1}>
                        <Row style={{paddingTop: '10px'}}>
                          <Col xs={6}>
                            <FontAwesome name='times' />
                          </Col>
                          <Col xs={6}>
                            <FontAwesome name='check' />
                          </Col>
                        </Row>
                    </Col>
                </Row>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Task;
```

The parts of the components I would like to make dynamic are the time section, the activity title and the activity description. But wait, if I‚Äôm making them dynamic, how am I going to pass data to it? Where is that data going to come from? ü§î
Follow along, and say hello to **Props** #LetsDoThis üòÑ
What are Props? Props are to react components what parameters are to functions. If you think about components like functions, then the way you define which parameters you pass to your functions is exactly how you would define your props as arbitrary inputs to be used in your react components. Applying that to our task component would give us something like this:
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Row, Col} from 'react-bootstrap';
import FontAwesome from 'react-fontawesome';

class Task extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Row>
                    <Col xs={1}>
                        <div>
                            <p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontWeight: 'bold', paddingTop: '10px'}}>{this.props.time}
                                <br/>
                                <span>{this.props.period}</span>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={10}>
                        <h4>{this.props.activity_title}</h4>
                        <p>{this.props.activity_description}</p>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={1}>
                        <Row style={{paddingTop: '10px'}}>
                          <Col xs={6}>
                            <FontAwesome name='times' />
                          </Col>
                          <Col xs={6}>
                            <FontAwesome name='check' />
                          </Col>
                        </Row>
                    </Col>
                </Row>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Task;
```

We didn‚Äôt change much, all we did was replace a bunch of static texts with this.props expressions. At this stage, if we take a look at our app, it‚Äôs going to look weird ‚Ä¶

Where did all the text go???? üò±üò±üò±
Don‚Äôt panic just yet üòâ ‚Ä¶ Think about it. We now have a component with props defined. If the tasks are being displayed this way, it‚Äôs because the tasks components don‚Äôt know what the values of props.time, props.period, props.activity_title and props.activity_description are. So we need to edit our task list component to make sure that we are giving our tasks their props values for it to work as expected. Let‚Äôs do that real quick.
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Task from './Task.js';

class TaskList extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
          <Task time="12" period="AM" activity_title="Finish Tutorial Series" activity_description="#ReactForNewbies" />
          <Task time="9" period="AM" activity_title="Meeting with Team Leads" activity_description="New Project Kickoff" />
          <Task time="11" period="AM" activity_title="Call Mom" activity_description="Return her call before she kills me" />
          <Task time="3" period="PM" activity_title="Fix Wifey's website" activity_description="FB Ads Integration not working" />
          <Task time="6" period="PM" activity_title="Do DB Backups" activity_description="Related to upcoming server migration" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default TaskList;
```

Look at that! Now we have dynamic tasks and our task list is displaying tasks based on which props we passed to each of them.
This is good ‚Ä¶ but it could be better. What if I could store all my tasks in an array so I can just loop through them to display my task list? Let‚Äôs tweak our task list component a bit.
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import Task from './Task.js';

class TaskList extends Component {
    render() {
        var tasks = [
            {
                'time': '12',
                'period': 'AM',
                'activity_title': 'Finish Tutorial Series',
                'activity_description': '#ReactForNewbies'
            }, {
                'time': '9',
                'period': 'AM',
                'activity_title': 'Meeting with Team Leads',
                'activity_description': 'New Project Kickoff'
            }, {
                'time': '11',
                'period': 'AM',
                'activity_title': 'Call Mom',
                'activity_description': 'Return her call before she kills me'
            }, {

Our app still looks the same but under the hood, we have a more flexible way to manipulate our data. Try changing anything, adding a new task, editing existing tasks or removing a task and see what happens on the app. üòÉ
That wasn‚Äôt too hard right? Let‚Äôs recap on what we did.
We introduced a new 3rd party library called MomentJS to work with dates. Even though we didn‚Äôt do much with it in this chapter, we will work with it a little more in the upcoming chapter.
We learned about props and applied them to make our task component dynamic.
We tweaked our tasklist component so we can pass data to it directly from an array of tasks.
We played around with our array of tasks to see our app automatically update itself with the state of our tasks array.
Let‚Äôs pause for a second and think about this array of tasks again. Based on what we‚Äôve seen, that means when adding a task, all we have to do is insert our task into the array of tasks and deleting a task just means removing that task from the array of tasks right? And we don‚Äôt have to worry about what happens on the UI side of things because it will automatically detect our changes and REACT to them ‚Ä¶ üòçüòçüòç
